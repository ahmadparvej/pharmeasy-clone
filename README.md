Challenges:

As this was my second collaborative project, We(team) faced a lot of challenges. Collecting data API’s was challenging for us we does not found any such API related to our project, we create own API and deploy on live server. Responsiveness is important part of web building, We were got stuck at many points of responsive feature of website. But we were able tackle all these problems in this week.

As we are still in the learning phase, the journey of building this website was very nice. We realised we could’ve achieved even more precision in building the website, but time was running out.

We still managed to pull this job to satisfactory results. Everyone was happy about it, it was like working hard on the farm, and then reaping the benefits of the tasty grains. The feeling of completing the project was very satisfying. Hard work pays off.
